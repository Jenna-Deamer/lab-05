        <h3>Growing Up</h3>
        <div class="p-div">
            <p id="p-1">
                I was born in Newmarket Ontario, on <em>October 12th, 2004.</em> I spent about ten
                years living in Newmarket with my mother and two older siblings. I moved
                to Barrie at the beginning of 7th grade to be closer to other family
                members and post-secondary institutions.
            </p>

        <h3> Education & Achievements</h3>
        <div class="p-div">
            <p id="color-p"> I attended Innisdale secondary and graduated in June 2022. I mostly enjoyed my
                technology-related classes
                such
                as the introduction to programming using Python. During a handful of my computer courses, I was
                achieving
                above-average grades, and I spent a lot of my time during some of these classes helping other
                students.
            </p>

        <h3> Future Goals</h3>
        <div class="p-div">
            <p id="p-3">
                I chose to attend post-secondary to better prepare for a career related to computer programming. I
                wanted to
                study computer programming because I enjoy working with computers and want to expand my knowledge.
                Currently, I
                am unsure what specific field I would like to go into. However, I hope to learn a lot about the
                different
                fields and find some that interest me.
